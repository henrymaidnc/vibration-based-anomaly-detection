# Research Questions

This research focuses on applying vibration-based anomaly detection to industrial rotating machinery, using the IMS Bearing Dataset as a real-world proxy.

The key research questions are:

## RQ1 – Early Anomaly Detection
Can vibration-based unsupervised models detect bearing degradation significantly earlier than the actual failure event?

## RQ2 – Time-Series Degradation Behavior
How does the anomaly score evolve over time as the bearing approaches failure?
Is the degradation gradual, sudden, or non-linear?

## RQ3 – Health Index Construction
Can the anomaly score be transformed into a meaningful Health Index (HI) that reflects the physical condition of the bearing?

## RQ4 – Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation
Can the Health Index trend be used as a Business Intelligence (BI) metric to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) without supervised labels?

## RQ5 – Industrial Decision Support
How can anomaly scores and RUL estimates support maintenance decisions such as:
- Maintenance scheduling
- Downtime optimization
- Reduction of unexpected machine failure?

This research emphasizes interpretability, robustness, and industrial applicability rather than maximizing model accuracy.
